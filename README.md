# PLB-2015F-ARGame
Tokyo Institute of Technology - Fall 2015 Project Based Learning Course - Koike Laboratory. The purpose of this project is to widen our field of knowledge by coming to other laboratory to work on a project. ARGame is a reality argumented sport game as we use a ball with embedded electronics, a IR camera to track the ball and a projector to project images on the ball as well as the environment.
